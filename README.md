# doorpal

This is an interactive doorbell/lock unit that can be controlled remotely using two way communication through a server.
When the doorbell is pressed, the owner recieves an SMS, notifying the presence of the person at the door. They can then either let the door timeout and remain locked while leaving a default message, leave the door locked and send a personal message to the LCD or unlock the door. When the unit is unlocked, the user can send a message, locking it at any time.
It has various uses, ranging from opening the door for a package to letting you in when you forget your keys.
