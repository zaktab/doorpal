This is an interactive doorbell-deadbolt unit that can be controlled remotely using two way communication through a server.
When the doorbell is pressed, the owner recieves a sms notifying the presence of the person at the door. They can then either let
the door timeout and remain locked leaving a default message, leave the door locked and send a personal message to the LCD or unlock
the door. When the unit is unlocked, the user can send a message, locking it at any time.
It has various uses, ranging from opening the door for a package to being ur keys guy. get the message?
